            "| **Increased goal‑directed activity** | Starting many projects, racing thoughts, or feeling “hyper‑productive.” |\n",
            "| **Reduced need for sleep** | Feeling rested after only a few hours or not needing sleep at all. |\n",
            "| **Talkativeness / pressured speech** | Speaking rapidly, jumping from topic to topic, or feeling compelled to talk. |\n",
